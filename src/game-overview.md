## Field
---
Across a 12’ x 12’ field (twelve by twelve feet), two alliances – red and blue alliance – each composed of two teams. The objective of High Stakes revolves around scoring rings of – 7” in diameter, with an inner diameter of 3”, along with a thickness of 2” – into various goals.

## Rings
---
In total, there are `44+4` rings placed within the field, `+4` refers to a preloaded ring for each robot prior to a match. The displacement of said rings are found across the field; for instance, the positive and negative corners, consisting of four stacks of four rings – red, blue, red, blue, or blue, red, blue, red – totalling `16` rings. *`(R1)`*

A set of four stacks of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are located along the right side *(refering to the blue alliance’s side)* of the Autonomous Line *(centre)*. Two additional stacks within the Autonomous Zone of each alliance consists of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red, with the opposing coloured ring found above the alliance colour. *`(R2a) (R2b)`*

Within the centre, a set of four stacks of one ring – red or blue – found inside the Ladder element of the game. The alliance rings are found opposite, in the opposing Autonomous Zone. *`(R3)`*

Towards the direct centre, along `X` position, two sets of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are situated near the Starting Line of each alliance. Furthermore, two additional sets of one ring – red or blue – lie directly over the Starting Line, the colour of the ring is opposite to the alliance colour of the ring’s Autonomous Zone. *`(R4a) (R4b)`*

Along the same horizontal level *(refer to field’s view)* as *`(MG3)`*, two sets of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are found. The layout of said rings are exact to the layout of *`(R2a)`* or *`(R2b)`*, depending on the side overviewed upon. *`(R5a)`*

Another two sets of one ring – red or blue – is found further away from *`(MG3)`*, having *`(R5a)`* being closer to the mobile goal, the two sets reflect the top ring colour of *`(R5a)`*. *`(R5b)`*

## Goals
---
There are ten locations for scoring points with rings, including, five mobile goals, two alliance goals – one red, one blue –, two neutral goals, and one Ladder goal.

**There are three sets of the five mobile goals:**
- **Two sets of mobile goals** in opposing Autonomous Zone(s) are placed to the rear of rings *`(R2a)`* and *`(R2b)`*. These are found to the right side of the field *(refer to blue alliance’s side)*. *`(MG1)`*
- **Two sets of mobile goals** in opposing Autonomous Zone(s) are placed in reflection of *`(MG1)`*, found on the left side of the field *(refer to blue alliance’s side)*, there are low numbers of rings accompanying said goals. *`(MG2)`* 
Sets *`(MG1)`* and *`(MG2)`* form a square surrounding the Ladder element. Each are `2’` apart from the corners of the Ladder.  
- Lastly, a mobile goal is situated along the Autonomous Line, on the left side, `2’` from the Western corner *(refer to blue alliance’s side)* of the Ladder element. *`(MG3)`* 
- Capacity: Mobile goals *`(MG1)(MG2)(MG3)`* hold up to a maximum of six rings, alliance goals *`(RG)(BG)`* hold up to a maximum of two rings, neutral goals *`(NG1)(NG2)`* hold up to a maximum of two rings, and the Ladder goal holds up to a maximum of one ring *`(LG)`*.  
- Alliance goals are team dependent, where only the alleged alliance may score, if a Team were to score a ring on their opponent’s Alliance Wall Goal *`(BG)(RG)`*, this results into a Minor/Major Violation.
