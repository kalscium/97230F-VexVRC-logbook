The competition consisted of three parts, qualifiers, skills and the finals. In qualifiers, each team would take part in a minimum of six matches, in a game between two alliances. However, the competition had ended with systematic errors cutting short of the final qualifier matches, alongside the official alliance selection matches.

### Teams

| --- | --- |
| **97230F** *(our team)* | 73005A |
| 96498D | 7479A |

### Summary
 The match began with *Autonomous* resulting in a win for the <span style="color:#3944BC">Blue Alliance</span> due to the team's autonomous having "`[broken]` the plane" over the Autonomous Line during their routine *(this issue with our autonomous routine was sw changed by our program as to prevent any futher penalties)*. The robots of Teams `96498D`, and `73005A` had minimal ability to score; leading to low scores for both alliances. During the match, Charlie managed to score a total of one ring due despite interference from our opponents. Unfortunately, this match ended with a loss for our alliance.

### Teams

| --- | --- |
| 97230D | **97230F** *(our team)* |
| 7479Y | 7479M |

### Summary
As neither of the <span style="color:#E3242B">red</span> or <span style="color:#3944BC">blue</span> alliances could score more points than another, the *Autonomous* period ended with a tie; awarding both alliances `3` autonomous points.

During the driver-control period, there were a total of `2` rings scored by our <span style="color:#3944BC">Blue Alliance</span> alongside a positive multiplier due to it being pushed into one of the positive corners.
- *It was also discovered that if the pneumatics were actuated within the last millisecond of the match, the pneumatics solenoid would toggle on and off repeatedly at a high rate even while the robot was disabled; draining battery and emptying the air-cylinder*
  - *This can be disregared as it doesn't affect the actual match itself as it may only occur after the match is over and the time inbetween solenoid actuations is far too short for any pistons to be moved*

### Summary
As neither of the <span style="color:#E3242B">red</span> or <span style="color:#3944BC">blue</span> alliances could score more points than another, the *Autonomous* period ended with a tie; awarding both alliances `3` autonomous points.

Due to neither of the <span style="color:#E3242B">red</span> or <span style="color:#3944BC">blue</span> alliances scoring *any* rings onto the mobile or stationary goals, the match entered with a tie-breaker in which the team with the largest amount of mobile goals at their end would win the match; fortunately, our <span style="color:#E3242B">Red Alliance</span> had managed to gather `3/5` mobile goals; winning us the match.

| 7479C | **97230F** *(our team)* |
| 7479Y | 3477A |

### Summary
Due to the disabling of our autonomous routine and a failed attempt of scoring by our team-mate, the <span style="color:#3944BC">Blue Alliance</span> won the `6` Autonomous win-points due to being able to score one ring on an *Alliance Stake*.

During the match, the precise controls implemented by Ethan allowed for easier maneuvering for Charlie; resulting in our robot scoring `1` ring during the match.

Overall, the match was played rather defensively, with both teams pressuring one another and preventing scoring by ramming and obstruction.

Unfortunately, due to losing the *Autonomous win-points*, the <span style="color:#3944BC">Blue Alliance</span> had won the match.

### Summary
The autonomous period of the match had ended with a draw due to neither of the <span style="color:#E3242B">red</span> or <span style="color:#3944BC">blue</span> alliances having a *working* autonomous routine.

During the match, the main strategy for our team was to score in separate mobile goals; allowing for triple the scored points given by the top rings.

Due to the <span style="color:#E3242B">Red Alliance</span> having minimal ability to score rings, the round mainly consisted of pushing and ramming; with the opposing team attempting to obstruct any scoring. However, despite their obstruction, two top rings were still able to be scored; securing our win for the match.

# Conclusion
---
Our second competition at Berwick college allowed ourteam to further understand both the game and what other teams have achieved and developed. The competition had also allowed us to play against other actual opponents; exposing bugs, errors, faults and short-comings in both the code and design of the robot that we will **ensure** to fix before the next tournament *(the nationals qualifier at **Rivercrest Cristian College**)* to hopefully make it to nationals then worlds.

## A Discovered Glaring Issue
---
The largest discovered issue with our robot was with the *new* pneumatics mogo *(mobile goal)* grabber. As, when testing the new design, we had tested it on either smooth tiles or smooth floorboards that our school provided and had therefore not accounted for the inclusion of friction on the foam tiles of the competition and the mogo would just slip out under the clamp; this would soon be fixed relatively quickly in later entries.
