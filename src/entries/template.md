## Goals

some sample text

## Issues
---
Woah, more sample text

## Solutions
---
Damn, that's a lot of sample text

## Plans
---
Some of this sample text could link to a more [detailed report](detailed-report.md) about code or robot schematics.

# Example Detailed Report on Code

---

Here is a random example program in rust that says `hello, world!`:

```rust
fn main() { // example comment
  const SUBJECT = "world"; // set the const to world
  println!("hello, {SUBJECT}!"); // print out value
}
```

As you can see above, that is indeed code

# Example Robot Design Report

We have done something to the robot through changing the thing to do this thing that does another thing, as shown in this photo: ![random robot photo](https://kb.vex.com/hc/article_attachments/4401926548756/image9.jpg) As you can see, the robot is quite indeed roboting.
