- **Aim:** to conduct tests on the belt conveyor system, and implement intake designs
- Strategies to hold the mobile goal were discussed
  - This includes mechanisms such as: pistons, trapdoors, motorised claws, etc
- ## Conveyor Belt
  - The conveyor belt system was thoroughly tested by feeding rings into the system and observing the outcomes
  - It was found that the system work perfectly and as intended

  - It was also observed that the conveyor belt system was weighing a ton and due to that, Hudson and Aaron decided to remvoe ecess parts of the conveyor in hopes of reducing the weight
  - The heavy steel bars of the robot were replaced by a lighter material; for instance, the aliminium C-channels were used a lot in the substitution
- ## Programming
  - Ethan began adding writing a system for recording the executed bytecode to generate an aseembly-like script of 'instructions' that, when copied into the source code of the robot, would get interpreted by a rust macro to create an array of bytecode to efficiently store them for execution during autonomous
  - ![Recording Code](../assets/2024-05-21_22/recording.webp)
  - This would allow for easily created autonomous routines as there was no need for *manual* programming *(though it was possible through changing or added instructions to the bytecode)* and could be instead easily recorded through the driver just driving the robot normally and have the actions be repeated with the exact timings for autonomous
  - In addition to this, Ethan also began thoroughly proof-reading over the old code and removed all of the unnesesary `Mutexe`s *(an old attempt at a solution to the robot not moving)*
- In future robotics sessions, we should try to innovate upon current ideas on the intake system and to further brainstorm and draft a system for grabing goals
