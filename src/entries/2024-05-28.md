- **Aim:** To research and apply data towards intake design
- The current goal was to construct a working robot before the first competition
- The field equipment was near arrival, this would allow for further drivetests and experiments to be conducted in the near future
- ## Conveyor Belt
  - The heavy central C-channel of the conveyor system was replaced by two lighter bars, which were similar in weight
  - This would provide a more balanced performance and drive experience to the robot
  - On top of that system, Hudson and Jake began building railings to contain the rights on the belt
  - More C-channels were also put into use to be applied as the railings
- ## Programming
  - We tested *recording* autonomous this robotics period and it had worked much more efficiently than last year's implementation
  - Though after testing the *running* of autonomous it was found that it did not work at all
  - It was also found that we were not able to switch over to driver control after we ran autonomous, which indicated that autonomous was stuck running in an infinite loop (we will look into this later)
  - The `JIT` compiled bytecode generated from the recording of autonomous seemed to be valid so it would be the bytecode interpreter's problem rather than the recorder's problem
  - Ethan also recently updated the robot's code to depend on `safe-vex` to the current `v3.2.0`
- In future robotics sessions, we should prepare for conducting tests on the new field and continue to research on intake and goal-grabbing system ideas
