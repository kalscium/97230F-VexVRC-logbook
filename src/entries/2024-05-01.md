- We brain-stormed ideas for a robot to compete in the recently released *VEX V5RC High Stakes 2024-2025* game
- We also refurbised the base of our previous robot *(for the VEX V5RC Over Under 2023-2024 game)* as the base for our new robot *(through removing old components such as the arm)*

- Research had also been conducted towards ideas for different means of scoring.
- Brainstormed scoring ideas include:
  - Forklift
  - Arm
  - Claw
  - Conveyor Belt with intake system

  - Scissor lift?

- Additionally, the thought of elevation of the robot was also considered though quickly discarded due to impracticalities
- **Strategy:** It was also planned for the robot to take possession of a mobile goal to ease the process of scoring
- This robotics session reinforced ideas for technique, scoring and strategy
