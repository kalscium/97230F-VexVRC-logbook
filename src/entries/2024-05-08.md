- The concept of elevation is ignored for the time being, as scoring rings is far more influential during matches.
- Ethan continued implementing experimental `filesystem` support to the `safe-vex` library (`v3.2.0-experimental`)
- It was discussed whether passing beneath the `16‚Äù` height of the base level of the Ladder was effective or not
- It was concluded that this should be considered in the future as the ability to travel underneath the central region would be a great convenience
- Brainstorming for previous ideas such as the four-bar linkage system, and intake to conveyor continues.
