- **Aim:** To let Charlie practice with the robot and compete against our school's other robots
-
- This robotics session will be the last robotics session before the competition we have on **Saturday**
- It mainly consisted of Charlie driving the robot; getting used to the controls and also scoring with the robot
- We also hosted a small scale mini-competition with another one of Highvale's robotics teams, and the 6-motor drive proved to be a well-worth invesment as we were able to traverse around the field without any meaningful obstructions from our *'opponent'*
- So far, the robot's stayed pretty consistent with it's scoring accuracy; with about `9` out of every `10` tries scoring
  - *In future we will probably try to increase this scoring probability through adding guiding bars to make it even more reliable*
- ## Logbook
  - The logbook was also a rather important aspect of this robotics club, as this year we really want to do everything to the best of our abilities
  - During this session Ethan continued working on our *`80` page* logbook to submit for the following competition on **Saturday** at **Rivercrest Christian College**
  - Daniel also assisted in the writing of the logbook by writing the competition entries and by also writing the first iteration of the logbook
