# Introduction
---
Welcome to *Vex VRC Robotics Team `97230F`*'s Digital Engineering Notebook! This book will be formatted so that each robotics club meeting will have it's own logbook entry with a brief summary of goals, issues, solutions and plans; with subchapters of that entry dedicated to in-depth details *(like code samples and diagrams)* by the team-members that specialise in or have worked on that aspect of the robot or plan.

Team `97230F` holds Robotics meetings on some Tuesday lunchtimes, and all Wednesday lunchtimes and afternoons. The team consists of seven members, each with their own unique roles based on their own individual skills.
