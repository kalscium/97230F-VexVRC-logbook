# Introduction
---
Welcome to *Vex VRC Robotics Team `97230F`*'s Digital Engineering Notebook! This book will be formatted so that each robotics club meeting will have it's own logbook entry with a brief summary of goals, issues, solutions and plans; with subchapters of that entry dedicated to in-depth details *(like code samples and diagrams)* by the team-members that specialise in or have worked on that aspect of the robot or plan.
