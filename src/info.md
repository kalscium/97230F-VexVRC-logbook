# Introduction
---
Welcome to *Vex VRC Robotics Team `97230F`*'s Digital Engineering Notebook! This book will be formatted so that each robotics club meeting will have it's own logbook entry with a brief summary of goals, issues, solutions and plans; with subchapters of that entry dedicated to in-depth details *(like code samples and diagrams)* by the team-members that specialise in or have worked on that aspect of the robot or plan.

Team `97230F` holds Robotics meetings on some Tuesday lunchtimes, and all Wednesday lunchtimes and afternoons. The team consists of seven members, each with their own unique roles based on their own individual skills.

# Game Overview *(VEX V5RC High Stakes 2024-2025)*
---
## Field
---
Across a 12’ x 12’ field (twelve by twelve feet), two alliances – red and blue alliance – each composed of two teams. The objective of High Stakes revolves around scoring rings of – 7” in diameter, with an inner diameter of 3”, along with a thickness of 2” – into various goals.

## Rings
---
In total, there are `44+4` rings placed within the field, `+4` refers to a preloaded ring for each robot prior to a match. The displacement of said rings are found across the field; for instance, the positive and negative corners, consisting of four stacks of four rings – red, blue, red, blue, or blue, red, blue, red – totalling `16` rings. *`(R1)`*

A set of four stacks of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are located along the right side *(refering to the blue alliance’s side)* of the Autonomous Line *(centre)*. Two additional stacks within the Autonomous Zone of each alliance consists of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red, with the opposing coloured ring found above the alliance colour. *`(R2a) (R2b)`*

Within the centre, a set of four stacks of one ring – red or blue – found inside the Ladder element of the game. The alliance rings are found opposite, in the opposing Autonomous Zone. *`(R3)`*

Towards the direct centre, along `X` position, two sets of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are situated near the Starting Line of each alliance. Furthermore, two additional sets of one ring – red or blue – lie directly over the Starting Line, the colour of the ring is opposite to the alliance colour of the ring’s Autonomous Zone. *`(R4a) (R4b)`*

Along the same horizontal level *(refer to field’s view)* as *`(MG3)`*, two sets of two rings – red, blue, or blue, red – are found. The layout of said rings are exact to the layout of *`(R2a)`* or *`(R2b)`*, depending on the side overviewed upon. *`(R5a)`*

Another two sets of one ring – red or blue – is found further away from *`(MG3)`*, having *`(R5a)`* being closer to the mobile goal, the two sets reflect the top ring colour of *`(R5a)`*. *`(R5b)`*

## Goals
---
There are ten locations for scoring points with rings, including, five mobile goals, two alliance goals – one red, one blue –, two neutral goals, and one Ladder goal.

**There are three sets of the five mobile goals:**
- **Two sets of mobile goals** in opposing Autonomous Zone(s) are placed to the rear of rings *`(R2a)`* and *`(R2b)`*. These are found to the right side of the field *(refer to blue alliance’s side)*. *`(MG1)`*
- **Two sets of mobile goals** in opposing Autonomous Zone(s) are placed in reflection of *`(MG1)`*, found on the left side of the field *(refer to blue alliance’s side)*, there are low numbers of rings accompanying said goals. *`(MG2)`* 
Sets *`(MG1)`* and *`(MG2)`* form a square surrounding the Ladder element. Each are `2’` apart from the corners of the Ladder.  
- Lastly, a mobile goal is situated along the Autonomous Line, on the left side, `2’` from the Western corner *(refer to blue alliance’s side)* of the Ladder element. *`(MG3)`* 
- Capacity: Mobile goals *`(MG1)(MG2)(MG3)`* hold up to a maximum of six rings, alliance goals *`(RG)(BG)`* hold up to a maximum of two rings, neutral goals *`(NG1)(NG2)`* hold up to a maximum of two rings, and the Ladder goal holds up to a maximum of one ring *`(LG)`*.  
- Alliance goals are team dependent, where only the alleged alliance may score, if a Team were to score a ring on their opponent’s Alliance Wall Goal *`(BG)(RG)`*, this results into a Minor/Major Violation.
